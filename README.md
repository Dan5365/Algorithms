# Laboratory 1: Functions and Recursion

## Overview
This project contains solutions to ten programming problems using functions and recursion in Java. Each problem demonstrates fundamental concepts such as recursion, iteration, mathematical computations, and string manipulation.

## Problems and Solutions
1. **Find Minimum in Array** - Determines the smallest element in an array.
2. **Calculate Average** - Computes the average of an array of numbers.
3. **Check Prime Number** - Uses recursion to determine if a number is prime.
4. **Factorial Calculation** - Computes the factorial of a given number recursively.
5. **Fibonacci Sequence** - Finds the n-th Fibonacci number using recursion.
6. **Exponentiation** - Computes `a^n` using recursive multiplication.
7. **Reverse Order Output** - Prints elements in reverse without using an array data structure.
8. **Check If String Contains Only Digits** - Verifies if a string consists only of numeric digits.
9. **Binomial Coefficient Calculation** - Computes `C(n, k)` using the recursive formula.
10. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** - Implements the Euclidean algorithm using recursion.


## Notes
- The recursive approach may not be the most efficient for all problems, but it helps understand fundamental recursion concepts.
- The Euclidean algorithm efficiently finds the GCD of two numbers.
- The binomial coefficient problem demonstrates combinatorial recursion.
