##  Description
The program finds the minimum element in the array, which is entered by the user.

## How to launch
1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**.
2. Launch `Main.java `.
3. Enter the size of the array of `n` and `n` integers.

##  Input data
- `n` is the size of the array.
- `n` numbers are the elements of the array.

###  Example:
**Input: 5 3 7 2 9 1**

# Time complexity
**O(n)** – the program traverses the array twice ('O(n) + O(n) → O(n)`).
